1. we are matching one supplier transaction against all buyer transaction.
2. if we have multiple partial matches we will return the best partial match
3. for partial match we are calculating diff of each field and comparing the same against the local threshold.
   if the diff is within the range of local threshold, we check for global threshold range.
3. if any of the fields is empty, in either of transactions we dont consider a partial match
4. one supplier transaction can be exact match of one buyer transaction,
    or can be partial match for other buyer transaction
5. One buyer transaction can be exact match for more than one seller transactions, and partial match for
    other seller transaction
